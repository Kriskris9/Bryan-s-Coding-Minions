## How we did this:

### By:
Defining the schema and defining/fill with the proper data.
Creating our models for the different pages, as well as javascript in our handlebars for their functionality.
Defining our routes for the models and their relationships.
Creating an view layer with handlebars and html with css with javascript logic to render the content.
